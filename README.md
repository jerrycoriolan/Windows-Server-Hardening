If we look at the password policy and recommendations section of the CIS benchmark, we can see that to ensure enforcement, the password history needs to be set to 24 or more passwords.

We can also see the impact and a step-by-step explanation of what to do. There are settings to change the group policy and deploy it across the entire organization on all of the Windows workstations in the domain, and they will have to follow the same rules.

CIS benchmark 1.1.2 to ensure maximum password age is set to 365 or fewer days, but not 0 ![image](https://github.com/jerrycoriolan/Windows-Server-Hardening/assets/168882662/4d533d91-94f4-4691-9ced-869dbbd0c982)

The final example is CIS benchmark 1.1.3 to ensure the minimum password age is set to 1 or more days![image](https://github.com/jerrycoriolan/Windows-Server-Hardening/assets/168882662/a134b560-14ba-4f46-b329-23d246dd1bc2)
